    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        One of the reasons I like to cook mostly healthy food is so I can justify the occasional dish like this one.
         Plus, any one-skillet meal where the pasta cooks right in the sauce is a gift with purchase, in my book.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Kosher or coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth, preferably low-sodium</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat. 
            Add the chicken, in batches if necessary, and sauté until nicely browned on the outside, 
            but still a bit pink inside, about 4 minutes (the pieces don’t have to be browned on all sides; 
            two sides is fine). Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.</li>
        <li>Do not clean the pan! Those brown bits on the bottom of the pan are going to add flavor to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir in the Parmesan until well incorporated, and adjust the seasonings.</li>
    </ol>
